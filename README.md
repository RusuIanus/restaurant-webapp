🌄 Mountain Restaurant – Frontend Version

This is the frontend version of my study project — a modern web application for a mountain restaurant.
The site includes a dynamic interface, light/dark theme switching, animations, API integrations, a menu, a partner section, and a booking system.

I am currently a student, and this project is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The backend functionality (authentication, comment storage, admin panel, database) will be developed next semester, when I start the Backend (Java) course.
